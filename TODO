* Register
This is not implemented at all yet.
To register, the client needs to:
- connect to the server
- retrieve registration form from the server
- fill out the values, then send them to the server
- wait for registration result, then authenticate

Some functionality for this is implemented in strophe.register.js (strophejs-plugins).
